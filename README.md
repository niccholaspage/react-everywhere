## react-everywhere

A test bed with sample projects using React in different ways.

Examples will include:

- CSR (Client Side Rendering)
  - Think `create-react-app` or Vite's `react-ts` template!
- Static SSR + SSG
  - This example includes static server side rendering and static site generation with renderToStaticMarkup. This is kind of like Astro with SSG, if it used React components instead of Astro components and had no concept of client hydration directives.
- Static SSR (Server Side Rendering with renderToPipeableStream) (TODO)
- SSR (Server Side Rendering) with Hydration (TODO)
- RSC (React Server Components) with CSR (TODO)
- RSC (React Server Components) with SSR and Hydration (TODO)
